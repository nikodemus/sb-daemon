  "Forks off a daemonized child process.

If PIDFILE is provided, it is deleted before forking, and the child
writes its PID in there after forking. Returns NIL in the child.

For complete daemonization use EXIT-PARENT, which causes the parent process to
exit after forking, otherwise the PID of the child process is returned in
parent. When EXIT-PARENT is used, the parent exits without unwinding or
running SB-EXT:*EXIT-HOOKS*.

When EXIT-PARENT is false (the default), EXIT-HOOK can be used to record
child's exit. It will be called asynchronously with three arguments: the pid
of the child, the manner of child's termination (:EXIT or :SIGNAL), and the
child's exit code or signal number that caused termination. The default exit
handler T will merely reap the child process so it will not remain in
zombiefied state. Users wanting to reap the child manually (via eg.
SB-POSIX:WAITPID) must explicitly provide NIL as the EXIT-HOOK to prevent
automatic reaping.

The child changes its current working directory to /, but
*DEFAULT-PATHNAME-DEFAULTS* is unaffected.

INPUT, OUTPUT, and ERROR designate files to which the child process
should connect its stdin, stdout, and stderr file descriptors.
Possible values are:

  NIL (the default), designating /dev/null.

  T, designating the corresponding file descriptor in parent.

  A pathname designator. The file is created if necessary,
  and opened for appending it if already exists.

  A list of the form:

   (pathname &key mkfifo create append truncate mode)

  where PATHNAME must be a pathname designator. If MKFIFO is true,
  a FIFO is created with the specied name and then opened. Otherwise
  a normal file is opened in the specified manner. If CREATE is true
  (default), and neither APPEND nor TRUNCATE is specified, an error is
  signaled if the file already exists. MODE is the mode to use for the
  file if it is created, defaulting to #o600.

  In all cases the files are opened before forking for easier error
  handling, and closed in parent afterwards.

UMASK specifies the umask for the child process. Default is #o022.

If DISABLE-DEBUGGER is true (default), SBCL's debugger is turned off in the
child process: any unhandled error terminates the process.

SIGABRT, SIGHUP, SIGINT, and SIGTERM can be used to specify
alternative handlers for those signals. :IGNORE and :DEFAULT can be
used to indicate that the signal should be ignored or that the default
OS handler should be used. Otherwise the handler should be a function
which will be called with a keyword indicating the signal. If they are
not provided, the currently installed handlers are used.

USER and GROUP can be used to drop privileges: user id is get using
setuid() to USER's uid, and correspondingly for GROUP with setgid().
USER and GROUP can either be specified as numeric ids, or as strings.
